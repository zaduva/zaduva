Hi I'm Zach! I just recently graduated with my Master's in Computer Science this past December. I am really interested in Machine Learning and AI, as well as cloud services and security. I am currently seeking employment to start my career. I have experience using Java, Python, JavaScript and C languages and use technologies, frameworks and libraries such as HTML, CSS, PostgresSQL, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, jQuery, Mongodb, pandas, NumPy, REST.  I enjoy working and solving complex projects and finding a well organized solution.
